# Pintos Projects Repository

This repository contains a series of projects for the Pintos operating system, which is designed for instructional purposes and runs on the 80x86 architecture. The projects build upon each other, adding features and complexity to the Pintos OS.

## Project 1: System Calls and Processes

### Overview
Project 1 focuses on enhancing the Pintos operating system by implementing argument passing, system call handling, and user memory protection.

### Features
- **Argument Passing**: Enable the kernel to pass arguments to user programs and verify with `hex_dump()`.
- **User Memory Access**: Protect user memory accesses during system calls.
- **System Call Handler**: Implement `syscall_handler()` to handle system calls.
- **System Call Implementation**: Implement system calls such as `exec()`, `exit()`, `write()`, `read()`, `wait()`, and `halt`. Additional system calls will be added later.
